transformer encoder block

in the paper, it has the normalization and MSA block with a residual connection, then the normalization and MLP block with a residual connection
this is all encapsulated in the transformer encoder block, which will be this file

we know there are 12 layers of the encoder, as table 1 shows layers L = 12, and equations 1-4 show that the MSA and MLP blocks range from l=1...L for z_l and z_l-1 respectively

"""
Transformer Encoder Block from Vision Transformer (ViT)

According to the ViT paper:
- Input goes through LayerNorm → Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) → Residual Connection (output = MSA(input) + input)
- Output goes through LayerNorm → Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) → Residual Connection (output = MLP(input) + input)
- Each encoder block processes its input and adds residual connections after MSA and MLP layers. (residual connections add the input before transformation to the output of the transformation)
- Number of encoder layers L = 12 (from Table 1)
- MSA and MLP layers are applied L times (see equations 1–4)

Architecture:
LayerNorm → MSA → Residual → LayerNorm → MLP → Residual
